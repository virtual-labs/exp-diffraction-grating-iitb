## Apparatus

<p>He-Ne Laser apparatus, Grating, Scale.</p>



## Theory

<p>The first continuous He-Ne laser was constructed in 1961. The beam is continuous, highly monochromatic, having high frequency & stability due to which it is very useful in communication engineering.</p>
<p>The process of stimulated emission of radiation is employed for light amplification. Stimulated emission is process of emission of photons by the transfer of atoms from excited state to ground state under the influence of an external agent. The active medium is mixture of He-Ne gas in the ratio 10:1. Like ordinary light, laser can undergo diffraction, interference, reflection, refraction etc. for obtaining the diffraction pattern, the laser beam emitted from apparatus made incident on the grating. The diffraction pattern consists of a central bright spot & 1st, 2nd order maxima on both sides of it as shown in diagram.</p>
